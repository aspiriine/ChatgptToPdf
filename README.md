## Why have I created ChatgptToPdf?

I decided to create ChatgtpToPdf because some time ago I contributed to improve [ChatGPT-pdf](https://github.com/liady/ChatGPT-pdf) created by [liady](https://github.com/liady), as a contributor I started receiving emails regarding issues that were appearing in the extension and I saw that liady stopped maintaining it.
Because of that, I started the development of ChatgtpToPdf, all the credits to the original idea fall in [liady](https://github.com/liady).
